# cis3250-team-project-1
Purpose:
The purpose of the code is to function as a regular, scientific, and accounting calculator.

Functionality:

The code functions by presenting a menu in a command loop. The user chooses which calculator to use. It then shows
a corresponding menu for that calculator. If the user chooses '1' from the command loop it will function as a regular calculator, where the program can perform operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiply, and Division for two values. The user can also choose to go back to the command loop by entering '0'.
If the user chooses '2' from the command loop the program will display the Scientific Calculator Menu, where the program can perform operations such as Raising to a power of 2 values, Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Matrix function and Conversion functions. The user can also go back to the command loop by entering '0'
If the user chooses '3' from the command loop the program will display the Accountant Calculator Menu, where the user must enter the amount of terms they would like to use, followed by each individual term. The user can then choose from a list of statistical calculations such as Show Max, Show Min, Show Range, Show Med, and Show Mode, all based on the terms they previously entered. The user can also choose '0' to go back to the command loop.
If the user chooses '4' from the command loop, the program will display the help and notice section, which essentially outlines how to use the program.
The user can enter '0' to exit from the command loop and quit the program.

How to run:
1. Clone from github master branch
2. Go to dispository where the program is located
3. Type "make" into the command line
